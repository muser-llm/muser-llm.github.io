            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p class="abstract-text">Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger <strong>context-awareness</strong>, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses.</p>
            <div class="figure">

                <div class="figure-caption">(a) Comparison between medical exam questions and real-world medical scenarios. (b) Overview of the proposed MuSeR framework.</div>
            </div>
            <p class="abstract-text">To address this issue, we propose <strong>Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR)</strong>, a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design an attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability.</p>
            
            <p class="abstract-text">Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model (GPT-oss-120B), achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (<strong>63.8%</strong>) and its hard subset (<strong>43.1%</strong>).</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="method">
            <h2>Method</h2>
            
            <p>To address the limitations of current medical LLMs in real-world scenarios, we introduce <strong>MuSeR (Multifaceted Self-Refinement)</strong>, a novel approach that enhances LLMs' medical context-awareness by synthesizing simulated real-world medical queries and generating context-aware responses by self-refining the answers of LLMs along diverse facets of context-awareness. Specifically, MuSeR features two core components:</p>
            
            <ol class="method-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Attribute-Conditioned Query Generation</strong>
                    <p>Firstly, we design a query generator to simulate the complexity of real-world query distribution. Specifically, we assume that the real-world query is controlled by a set of attributes (e.g., user role, intent, geographic location). Built on that, the proposed attribute-conditioned query generator first samples a set of attributes from a prior distribution, and then generates a query conditioned on the sampled attributes using a LLM.
    </p>
                    <p>In our framework, we consider a total of seven key attributes for query generation. These attributes are chosen to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world medical queries:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>🧑‍⚕️ User identity (patient, caregiver, or doctor)</li>
        <li>🌍 Geographic region (country, urban/rural area)</li>
        <li>🩺 The specific disease or injury being inquired about</li>
        <li>🎯 User intent (seeking diagnosis, treatment advice, report interpretation, etc.)</li>
        <li>❓ Vagueness of the intent (clear, vague)</li>
        <li>📋 Completeness of the provided details (complete, incomplete)</li>
        <li>✍️ Language style (formal, informal)</li>
    </ol>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Multifaceted Self-Refinement</strong>
                    <p>Secondly, we construct a multifaceted self-refinement module where an LLM responds to the generated queries, evaluates its answers along the three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. We primarily consider three key facets of context-awareness that are crucial for providing safe, helpful, and appropriate responses in the medical domain:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Decision-Making Awareness:</strong> This facet focuses on identifying critical information (e.g., medical history, medication, examination results) essential for accurate medical decision-making, as well as actively seeking missing details from users when necessary. Such awareness is critical for ensuring the accuracy and practical utility of medical advice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication Awareness:</strong> This facet involves recognizing the user's identity (e.g., patient, doctor) and response preferences, and tailoring both terminology (e.g., layman vs. professional) and level of detail (e.g., brief vs. comprehensive) accordingly. This facet is essential for providing responses that match the user's knowledge background and expectations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Safety Awareness:</strong> This facet requires the model to recognize potential risk factors (e.g., symptom severity, underlying conditions) and ethical considerations (e.g., the use of unproven drugs) in its responses. Such awareness is vital for ensuring both the safety and ethical integrity of the medical advice provided.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For each generated query, the target LLM first generates an initial response. Subsequently, the LLM self-evaluates the answer along each facet above and generates a supplementary rationale to explain how the answer can be improved to better align with the requirements of the facet. For example, for the decision-making awareness facet, the model may identify missing critical information in the query and generate a rationale such as "We should ask about the patient's current medications to make an accurate diagnosis". Finally, the refined answer is generated by prompting the LLM to directly refine the initial answer based on the query and the generated rationales.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Training Strategy</h3>
            <p>We propose a two-stage supervised finetuning to improve LLMs' medical context awareness:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Query-Guided Knowledge Distillation:</strong> This training phase aims to inject essential medical knowledge and reasoning abilities into the target LLM to support context-aware responses. Specifically, a strong teacher LLM first generates high-quality responses for the synthesized queries, and the target LLM is then fine-tuned to align its outputs with those of the teacher before proceeding to the multifaceted self-refinement stage. We observe that this stage not only enhances the medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the student model but also improves the effectiveness of the subsequent self-refinement process.</li>

                    <li><strong>Multifaceted Self-Refinement:</strong> Following knowledge distillation, the distilled LLM is further employed to generate multifaceted, self-refined responses. The synthesized queries along with the refined answers are then used for supervised fine-tuning of the distilled model, thereby improving its medical context-awareness and response quality.</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Key Finding:</strong> By incorporating knowledge distillation with MuSeR, a smaller backbone model (Qwen3-32B) achieves performance that surpasses its teacher model, establishing a new state-of-the-art among all open-source medical LLMs. The most significant improvements are observed in context-awareness metrics, validating our approach's effectiveness in enhancing this critical capability.
